My favorite villains aren’t the ones with magic powers — it’s the ones armed with technology and strategy. The ones who study, predict, and counter their enemies. Think Shroud from Dispatch or Taskmaster from Spider-Man — they don’t win because they’re stronger, they win because they're smarter.
Rainbow Six Siege players are getting too damn good. My reaction time isn’t enough anymore — I need information, prediction, and strategy.
So… I built a tool to help.

Using player stats pulled from R6 Tracker, this tool feeds the data into an LLM which:
Analyzes enemy playstyle
Predicts how they’re likely to play
Suggests counter-strategies adapted to their behavior
The goal isn’t full automation or cheating — it’s giving you a mental advantage before the round even starts.
